Your support tickets pile up. Your customers deserve monthly updates on how you're handling their issues, which features you shipped, what's improving. But writing those reports by hand? Your 14-person team has products to build.

We had this exact problem. Then we stopped thinking about LLMs as experimental tech and started treating them as team members who excel at specific tasks.

## The moment it clicked

Last quarter, someone floated the idea of customer reports again. Previously, this sat in our "eventually" pile—too manual, too time-consuming. This time, someone asked: "Can an LLM do it?"

We connected our Intercom data to an LLM. It scanned ticket histories, pulled response examples, identified feature releases, and wrote comprehensive monthly reports. The whole process runs automatically now.

The reports are better than what we'd write manually. More detailed. More consistent. Actually completed on schedule.

## The workflow that writes itself

User interviews follow the same pattern. We used to take notes during conversations, then spend hours translating those notes into actionable GitHub issues. Maybe we'd get to it that week. Maybe next.

Now we use Granola to capture the conversation. The transcript flows to Claude. Claude generates a GitHub issue with context, user quotes, and priority signals. The issue lands in our sprint backlog while the user is still on the call.

We went from "someday we'll review these notes" to "sprint planning starts with real user needs."

## The culture shift

This isn't about loving technology. It's about respecting your team's time.

Every workflow now gets the same treatment. We ask: "Can an LLM do it?" Not as a thought experiment. As a literal test. Can we hand this task to an LLM this afternoon and get reliable results?

When the answer is yes, we automate. When it's no, we understand exactly which human skills the task requires—and we make sure those skills get applied to work that deserves them.

## What 14 people can actually accomplish

Operating LLM native means our small team punches above its weight. We ship customer reports that enterprise companies struggle to produce. We turn user feedback into sprint tasks faster than most teams schedule their meetings.

The leverage comes from eliminating entire categories of work. Not optimizing them. Eliminating them.

We don't transcribe interviews—LLMs do. We don't extract data from support tools—LLMs do. We don't format reports—LLMs do.

We make product decisions. We solve hard technical problems. We build relationships with customers. The work that requires human creativity and judgment gets our full attention because the mechanical work runs in the background.

## How to start

Pick one workflow that's necessary but tedious. Ask if an LLM can handle it. Test the answer this week.

You'll find tasks you've been doing manually for years that algorithms handle better. Automate those. Then find the next one.

Being LLM native isn't a strategy you announce. It's a habit you build, one automated workflow at a time.
