# Hello World

Welcome to my personal homepage! After years of having my thoughts scattered across various platforms, I decided it was time to create a central place for my writing and projects.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple, clean space where I could:

- Share my thoughts on programming and technology
- Document my learning journey
- Connect with other developers and creators
- Have full control over my content

## What You'll Find Here

This site will be home to my writing on:

- **Programming**: Tips, tutorials, and lessons learned
- **Open Source**: Projects I'm working on and contributing to
- **Technology**: Thoughts on emerging tech and industry trends
- **Tools**: Reviews and recommendations for developer tools

## Built With

This site is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's hosted on Replit and the source code is available on GitHub. I chose these tools for their simplicity and developer experience.

## Stay Connected

If you'd like to follow along with my journey, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/luchotourn), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/luchotourn), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/luchotourn).

Thanks for stopping by!
